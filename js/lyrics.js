        title: "Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen",
        lyrics: "Is this the real life?\nIs this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide\nNo escape from reality\nOpen your eyes\nLook up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go\nLittle high, little low\nAny way the wind blows\nDoesn't really matter to me, to me\n\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head\nPulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\n\nMama, ooh\nDidn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\nToo late, my time has come\nSent shivers down my spine\nBody's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody, I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooh\nI don't want to die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche, Scaramouche, can you do the Fandango?\nThunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me\nGalileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico\nI'm just a poor boy nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\n\nEasy come, easy go, will you let me go?\nBismillah! No, we will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go)(Never) let you go\n(Let me go)(Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nOh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!\n\nSo you think you can stop me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!\n\nNothing really matters, Anyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\nAny way the wind blows..."

        title: "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zepellin",
        lyrics: "There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold\nAnd she's buying a stairway to heaven\nWhen she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed\nWith a word she can get what she came for\n\nOoh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven\n\nThere's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure\n'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings\nIn a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings\nSometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven\n\nOoh, it makes me wonder\nOoh, it makes me wonder\n\nThere's a feeling I get when I look to the west\nAnd my spirit is crying for leaving\nIn my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees\nAnd the voices of those who stand looking\n\nOoh, it makes me wonder\nOoh, it really makes me wonder\n\nAnd it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune\nThen the piper will lead us to reason\nAnd a new day will dawn for those who stand long\nAnd the forests will echo with laughter\n\nIf there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now\nIt's just a spring clean for the May Queen\nYes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run\nThere's still time to change the road you're on\n\nAnd it makes me wonder\n\nYour head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know\nThe piper's calling you to join him\nDear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know\nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind\n\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one and one is all\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to heaven"

        title: "Hotel California by Eagles",
        lyrics: "On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair\nWarm smell of colitas, rising up through the air\nUp ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light\nMy head grew heavy and my sight grew dim\nI had to stop for the night\n\nThere she stood in the doorway;\nI heard the mission bell\nAnd I was thinking to myself,\n'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'\nThen she lit up a candle and she showed me the way\nThere were voices down the corridor,\nI thought I heard them say...\n\nWelcome to the Hotel California\nSuch a lovely place (such a lovely place)\nSuch a lovely face\nPlenty of room at the Hotel California\nAny time of year (any time of year)\nYou can find it here\n\nHer mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends\nShe got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends\nHow they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.\nSome dance to remember, some dance to forget\n\nSo I called up the Captain,\n'Please bring me my wine'\nHe said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'\nAnd still those voices are calling from far away,\nWake you up in the middle of the night\nJust to hear them say...\n\nWelcome to the Hotel California\nSuch a lovely place (such a lovely place)\nSuch a lovely face\nThey livin' it up at the Hotel California\nWhat a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)\nBring your alibis\n\nMirrors on the ceiling,\nThe pink champagne on ice\nAnd she said 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'\nAnd in the master's chambers,\nThey gathered for the feast\nThey stab it with their steely knives,\nBut they just can't kill the beast\n\nLast thing I remember, I was\nRunning for the door\nI had to find the passage back to the place I was before\n'Relax,' said the night man,\n'We are programmed to receive.\nYou can check-out any time you like,\nBut you can never leave!'\n"

        lyrics: "Once upon a time you dressed so fine\nYou threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?\nPeople'd call, say, `Beware doll, you're bound to fall` \nYou thought they were all kiddin' you\n You used to laugh about\nEverybody that was hangin' out\nNow you don't talk so loud\n Now you don't seem so proud\nAbout having to be scrounging for your next meal.\n\nHow does it feel\n How does it feel\n To be without a home\nLike a complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone? \n\n You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely\n But you know you only used to get juiced in it\n And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street\n And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it\n You said you'd never compromise\n With the mystery tramp, but now you realize\n He's not selling any alibis\n As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes\n And say do you want to make a deal? \n\n How does it feel\n How does it feel\n To be on your own\n With no direction home\nA complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone? \n\n You never understood that it ain't no good\n You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you\n You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat\n Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat\n Ain't it hard when you discover that\n He really wasn't where it's at\n After he took from you everything he could steal. \n\n How does it feel\n How does it feel\n To be on your own\n With no direction home\n Like a complete unknown\n Like a rolling stone?\n\n Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people\n They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made\n Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things\n But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe\n You used to be so amused\n At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used\n Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse\n When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose\n You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal.\n\n How does it feel\nHow does it feel\nTo be on your own\n With no direction home\n Like a complete unknown\n Like a rolling stone?"

        title: "Lose Yourself by Eminem",
        lyrics: `Look
        If you had
        One shot
        Or one opportunity
        To seize everything you ever wanted
        In one moment
        Would you capture it
        Or just let it slip?
        Yo
        His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
        There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
        He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
        To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
        What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
        He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
        He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
        The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
        Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
        Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
        He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
        He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
        It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
        He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
        Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
        Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better
        His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
        This world is mine for the taking
        Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
        A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
        It only grows harder, only grows hotter
        He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
        Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
        Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
        He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
        But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
        These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
        They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
        So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
        Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better
        No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
        Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
        I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
        I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
        But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
        Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
        All the pain inside amplified by the
        Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
        Five and I can't provide the right type of
        Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
        And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
        This is my life and these times are so hard
        And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
        Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
        Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
        For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
        Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
        To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
        Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
        Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
        So here I go, is my shot
        Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
        You own it, you better never let it go
        You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
        This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
        You better
        You can do anything you set your mind to, man`

        No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
        Birthdays was the worst days

        lyrics: `It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        Broken glass everywhere
        People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
        I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
        Got no money to move out, I guess, I got no choice
        Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
        Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
        I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
        'Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car
        Don't push me
        'Cause I'm close to the edge
        I'm trying not to lose my head
        Ah-huh-huh-huh
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        Standin' on the front stoop, hangin' out the window
        Watchin' all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
        A crazy lady, livin' in a bag
        Eatin' out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag
        Said, she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango
        A Zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses
        Down at the peep show, watching all the creeps
        So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
        She went to the city and got so saditty
        She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
        Don't push me
        'Cause I'm close to the edge
        I'm tryin' not to lose my head
        Ah-huh-huh-huh
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        My brothers doin' bad, stole my mothers TV
        Says, she watches to much, is just not healthy
        All My Children in the daytime, Dallas, at night
        Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
        The bill collectors, they ring my phone
        And scare my wife, when I'm not home
        Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
        Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
        Neon King Kong standin' on my back
        Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
        A midrange migraine, cancered membrane
        Sometimes I think I'm going insane
        I swear I might hijack a plane
        Don't push me
        'Cause I'm close to the edge
        I'm tryin' not to lose my head
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
        'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think, I'm a fool
        And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
        If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
        Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
        Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
        'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
        You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
        They pushed that girl in front of the train
        Took her to the doctor, sewed the arm on again
        Stabbed that man right in his heart
        Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
        I can't walk through the park, 'cause it's crazy after the dark
        Keep my hand on the gun, 'cause they got me on the run
        I feel like an outlaw, broke my last glass jar
        Hear them say, you want some more? Livin' on a see-saw
        Don't push me
        'Cause I'm close to the edge
        I'm tryin' not to lose my head (Say what?)
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
        How I keep from going under
        A child is born, with no state of mind
        Blind to the ways of mankind
        God is smilin' on you, but he's frownin' too
        Because only God knows, what you'll go through
        You'll grow in the ghetto, livin' second rate
        And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
        The place, that you play and where you stay
        Looks like one great big alley way
        You'll admire all the number book takers
        Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money makers
        Driving big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
        And you wanna grow up to be just like them
        Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
        Pickpockets, peddlers and even pan-handlers
        You say I'm cool, I'm no fool
        But then you wind up dropping out of high school
        Now you're unemployed, all null 'n' void
        Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
        Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
        Got sent up for an eight year bid
        Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
        Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
        Being used and abused and served like hell
        'Til one day you was found hung dead in a cell
        It was plain to see that your life was lost
        You was cold and your body swung back and forth
        But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
        Of how you lived so fast and died so young
        So, don't push me
        'Cause I'm close to the edge
        I'm trying not to lose my head

        So the bar is where I go
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots
        Drinking fast and then we talk slow
        Come over and start up a conversation with just me
        And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
        And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
        Girl, you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        Come on now, follow my lead
        I may be crazy, don't mind me
        Say, boy, let's not talk too much
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me
        Come on now, follow my lead
        Come, come on now, follow my lead
        I'm in love with the shape of you
        We push and pull like a magnet do
        Although my heart is falling too
        I'm in love with your body
        Last night you were in my room

        I'm in love with your body
        Every day discovering something brand new
        I'm in love with the shape of you
        One week in we let the story begin
        We're going out on our first date
        You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
        Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
        We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
        And how your family is doing okay
        Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
        Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
        Girl, you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        Come on now, follow my lead
